# _JavaTextEditor_

#### _A simple text editor I created to work with Jira so I could have my comments auto save. Sometimes in my work I have to type out longer analytical comments and I was afraid of loosing my work at times. I used notepad for a bit but thought this would make a fun project. The main features are a reference pane for Jira Text Formatting Notation with functionality to edit selected text, and auto saving._
